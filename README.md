- **Required Libraries:**  
  - `pandas`  
  - `plotly.express`  
  - `panel`  
- Run `spotifydash.py` to launch the dashboard.

### DS2000: Intro to Programming with Data  
#### hw6.py  
- This script analyzes sets of text data.  
- Requires `hw6_data.zip` to be unzipped in the same directory.  
- **Required Libraries:**  
  - `matplotlib.pyplot`  
- Run `hw6.py` as a standalone script.

### DS2500: Intermediate Programming with Data  
#### hw4.ipynb  
- Clusters news articles using TF-IDF, PCA, and KMeans based on terms like "environment" and "climate change."  
- Requires an API key for fetching news data.  
- **Required Libraries:**  
  - `requests`  
  - `sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer`  
  - `sklearn.decomposition.PCA`  
  - `sklearn.cluster.KMeans`  
  - `matplotlib.pyplot`
